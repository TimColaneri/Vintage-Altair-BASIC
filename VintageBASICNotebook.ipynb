    "## Introduction\n",
    "Initailly, I was pretty unfamiliar with Vintage, or Altair, BASIC. I had taken a few database courses in the past in which I had the opportunity to see a few examples of code written in a few BASIC dialects, so I was not completely foreign to this language. However, I certainly did not have a expert understanding of how its syntax and semantics worked. Below is an example of a program written in this language, taken from the Vintage BASIC homepage's game section. It is a text verion of the game Russian Roulette."

    "I think it makes sense here for me to explain how I handled the labeled lines within this language first as this will flow into and help describe my key data structure for interpreting the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first observations I had made after looking at sample code from this langauge is that each line in the program has an associated number attached to it. What I had originally though were probably just lines from the develpment environment turned out to be part of the actual syntax of the program.  \n",
    "  Example program 1:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     10 print \"a\"\n",
    "     20 print \"b\"\n",
    "     30 print \"c\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in Vintage BASIC has a label space at the very beginning of it. These labels serve two purposes. First, they define the order in which the lines of the program should be executed. Second, they provide targets for 'jump' commands, which allow the flow of the program to change to another designated part of the program.  \n",
    "  Example Program 2: will execute the same order as example 1 due to flow control of program\n",
    "    \n",
    "    30 print \"c\"\n",
    "    10 print \"a\"\n",
    "    20 print \"b\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The language that I am interpreting in, Python, has no such flow control labels. Python executes in a traditionaly imperative way, line by line, one at a time. As such, I can't 1:1 map this behavior into Python. I will have to derive my own method of emulating this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will need to be able to index into and switch control of my program to a indicated label at any time in the program. One similiar example that we had worked on in class is the stack machine, which had label spaces. In this example we used a list, which can operate like a stack in Python, to allow us to index to a given point in the stack. A list structure would work well for indexing into certain parts of the code. However, each line in the stack machine could only have one command, making its interpreter more simple then ours will have to be, considering we can have multiple statements on a line, serperated by ':'.  \n",
    "Example Program 3:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    10 let y = 10 : print y : let x = 42 : print x\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to interpret a list of statements, we can use a tree walking structure. Similiar to many of the in class examples, we recursively walk down a tree and execute the different instructions based on the the type of node generated by grammar and parser generator(PLY). Which leads us into..\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation \\ Key Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "By storing each line of code( label space) in a different element in a list, we will be able to index into a given point(label) of the program whenever we encounter a 'jump' command. By keeping a 1:1 parallel list of the actual labels, we will know which statement list belongs to which label.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first take code into the interpreter, the very first part of the processing is to 'split' the program into two lists, one of labels and one of the associated code. These lists are parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quicksort algorithm is then used to place these instructions in execution order which will allow far easier processing in our imperative interpretation environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is then put back together in execution order and passed into the parser to populate the second list with tuples containing each lines code parallel to the label list.  \n",
    "Essentially..  \n",
    "List1 = list of label space names  \n",
    "List2 = List of label space code  \n",
    "There is a 1:1 direct parallel realationship between these lists. (ex. List1[0] and List2[0] contain the label name and code of the same label.)  \n",

    "## Challenges\n",
    "I had run into quite a few more challenges then I thought I would when implementing this interpreter. I was under the impression that BASIC was a little more simplier then it turned out to be.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "*** My initial implementation stored the program everytime we encountered a line into a symbol table. The way this worked was that every line's entry in the symbol table contained not only that lines code but every single following lines code. For example, the first line had the entire program stored within its table entry, the second line had the entire program minus the first line... etc..  \n",
    "This made my required memory space the summation of the space required for the input program. As we know from cominatorics, this is n^2 + n memory space(constant dropped). As we also know from lecture, the possible input set for any(or most) programming languages is infinite, there are lots of possibilities for large programs. I'm glad I was able to think of another implementation!  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "*** Besides, the previously mentioned labels, another issue I had in this language was constructing its for loops. I had to go to office hours to find a way to parse them as my initial implementation had somehow confused that parser generator. Once I had successfully parsed these statements it was pretty downhill in terms of difficulty for implementing it.  \n",
    "However... I have made an observation about Vintage BASIC for loops that I would like to share.  \n",
    "When I initially came to office hours to find a way to parse the for loops, one of my grammar ideas looked like this...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    stmt : FOR ID '=' EXP opt_step \n",
    "         | NEXT op_var\n",
    "         \n",
    "We had determined that this could not be the grammar as you would not be able to get all of the code into one tuple, in addition to the NEXT statement being a valid sentence.  \n",
    "After some research, I believe that this may be the actual implementation of the grammar (or at least something like it), meaning that Vintage BASIC does not have a static for loop structure but rather somewhat of a dynamic one.\n",
    "This raises many questions as to how such a system would work, take for example this quote from the Vintage BASIC homepage concerning the NEXT statement.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\" How does the interpreter determine which FOR goes with the NEXT? It is determined dynamically. If the NEXT has no variable, then it is the most recently encountered non-terminated FOR. If the NEXT indicates a variable, then it is the most recently encountered non-terminated FOR with that control variable. Usually, it is simple to glance at code and see which pairs of FOR and NEXT statements go together. But due to the dynamic nature of the connection between them, it is possible to write NEXT statements that are sometimes connected with one FOR, sometimes another.\"  \n",
    "  \n",
    "As you can see, a NEXT statement may be connected to multiple FOR loops. While I'm not convinced that my above grammar is that actual implementation, I also don't think that the solution we had come to will parse such a structure. The next statement having an optional variable is very telling as well, this statement can encounter a for loop and decide that it is the wrong one to update with this variable attached. In my implementation, below, every FOR loop is connected to its own NEXT statement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    stmt : FOR ID '=' exp opt_step stmts NEXT opt_var\n",
    "    \n",
    "*** I also had a little trouble with the RESTORE statement. I believe this problem that I ran into is the same that I had recieved help for during office hours for the FOR loop. There are two forms of RESTORE; RESTORE, and RESTORE label. I believe my grammer for RESTORE label confused the parser generator; I think that whenever it didn't encounter a label, it read the label from the following line, failing the parsing process. The RESTORE only statements works fine. Here is what this looked like in the grammar.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    stmt : RESTORE opt_int\n",
    "    \n",
    "    opt_int : INTEGER\n",
    "            | empty\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "I learned a lot through the process of constructing this interpreter, and I have quite a few ideas for improvements. These are some of the better examples. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\\- First of all, concerning my key data structure of 2 parallel lists, I think that this could be done in a more elegent way in a language that allows the use of pointers. Pointers allow us to index into a specific memory space. Had I had access to pointers when construcing this inerpreter, I imagine I would not have needed to use lists at all. When parsing the program, Each labels location in memory could be indexed instead in a symbol table. This would allow us to iterate through the program and switch flow control within a nested tuple structure by using these pointers as opposed to needing to index into a list.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "\\- I would really like to find a method of handling for loops that may have a changing structure. In such an implementation, when encountering a next node, we would need to immediatly recurse up the tree until we get to the appropriate for node. Perhaps such a system could be implemented by throwing custom exceptions. Each FOR node would continue the code in a try statement, while each NEXT statement would throw the type of error the FOR was looking for. The FOR node could then check to see if the recieved variabel is the right one, and if not throw it again until it gets to the right FOR node. I think this would be a good challange to implemenet if I had more time.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\\- I based my interpreter contruction on the Vintage BASIC homepage documentation. There exist a few minor inconsistancies accross the interpretation in syntax that could be cleaned up to more exactly emulate the interpreted language. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\- I could also improve upon the typing. There is not much to typing in Vintage BASIC. However, it appears that there is a varaible naming structure; Specifically, string varaibles should end with the $ character. This is something I had overlooked. At current, typing is handled behind the scenes to emulate Vintage BASIC. My implementation handles what you should be able to do and not be able to do concerning types pretty well.\n",
